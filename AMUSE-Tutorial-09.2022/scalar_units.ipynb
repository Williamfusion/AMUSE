Assume that there are asteroids with semimajor axes between 0 and 3.5 AU (the outer edge of the asteroid belt), with eccentricities between 0 and 0.4. Note that for an elliptic orbit, the peri- and apocenter distances are $(1\\pm e)a$, and the peri- and apocenter speeds are $\\sqrt{\\frac{(1\\pm e)\\cdot GM}{(1\\mp e)a}}$. Is the acceleration due to the Earth's gravitational well important?\n",
